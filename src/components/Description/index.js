    <strong>About this Project</strong>
    <p>
        Layers of Labour of Love reflects on labour, love, and acts of care that have been especially prominent in our communities over the last year. Twice a week for four weeks, we exchanged two digital collages and each added new drawings or scanned images of plants, textiles, and other everyday objects to develop this diptych. These reciprocating acts of care – through the labour of consciously contributing to each other’s work – has culminated in a visual representation of what could only be the result of a truly collaborative effort.

        Paired by DesignTO, we participated in an exchange of conversations, readings, and our own artworks, to learn about each other’s personal narratives that inspire us to make the art that we do. Now, we invite you to create your own digital collage using the same layers that we used to create Layers of Labour of Love.
